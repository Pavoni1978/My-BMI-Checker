## Features:

#### **Colour Scheme:**
- The main colours used are in a beige and light grey scale. The text is pulled forward from the background, assisting legibility. These colours also compliment the illustration and photographic resources on the website highlighted with a 2px black border. The black text on light grey background makes for easy reading on all platforms. Hence the main input field and results section is in light grey.

#### **Typography:**
- The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. The website header also uses Arial font with sans-serif as backup. This creates a nice consistancy throughout the site for easy reading on all devices.

### Existing Features:
An input area for your weight and height, with a button to click "Get My BMI".
A results area to display "Your BMI"
Two graphs are provided for men and women to assess your score.

### **Languages Used:**
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
- [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

#### **Debugging:**
Debugging was difficult with regards to the Javascript code working correcting to display my end result.

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:
1. In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch.
3. Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
4. The live link can be found [HERE - My BMI Checker](https://pavoni1978.github.io/My-BMI-Checker/)

#### **Commits:**
Still working on some of my commits messages as many are not as precise as I would have wanted them to be. I do find committing everthing very frustrating when trying to get code to work. Did not find it easy to learn the Codeanywhere and GitHub databasis. Had to migrate to Codeanywhere for this project. I do however prefer Codeanywhere.

#### **Media:**
- The images used on the website were all obtained in Google Images.com. (https://images.google.com/)
